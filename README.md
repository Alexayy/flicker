**FLICKER: Capture Memories in a Flash âœ¨**

**FLICKER** is a versatile screenshot application for Linux that empowers you to seamlessly capture, organize, and cherish those fleeting moments on your screen.

**FLICKER** stands for **Fast Linux Interface for Capturing & Keeping Exceptionally Radiant screenshots**. Corny.

**Features:**

- Capture full screen, specific windows, or custom selections with ease.
- Save screenshots in a dedicated `Pictures/FLICKERs` folder for effortless organization.
- Support for both X11 and Wayland display servers.
- Intuitive keyboard shortcuts for lightning-fast capture:
    - WIN + Shift + S (or ALT + Shift + S / F6): Capture a selection
    - WIN + Shift + W (or ALT + Shift + W / F7): Capture the current window
    - WIN + Shift + D (or ALT + Shift + D / F8): Capture the entire screen

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alexayy/flicker
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd flicker
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**

1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python -m flicker.app
   ```
2. Use the keyboard shortcuts to capture screenshots:
    - WIN + Shift + S (or ALT + Shift + S / F6): Capture a selection
    - WIN + Shift + W (or ALT + Shift + W / F7): Capture the current window
    - WIN + Shift + D (or ALT + Shift + D / F8): Capture the entire screen

You can also call ``grab-screen`` directly for one-off captures. By default it
lets you select a region and then opens the result with your desktop image
viewer. Use ``--full`` or ``--window`` to change the mode.

### Running as a background service

Copy ``flicker.service`` to ``~/.config/systemd/user/`` and enable it:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now flicker.service
```

This starts the hotkey listener automatically on login.

**Planned Features:**

- Customizable save locations and filename conventions.
- Annotations and editing tools for screenshots.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
- Copy to clipboard
- Better support for X11 and Wayland
